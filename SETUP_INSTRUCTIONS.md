# HR Time Tracking System - Post-Setup Instructions

## ðŸŽ‰ Setup Complete!

Your HR Time Tracking System has been set up. Here's what to do next:

## 1. Update Your Login Page

In your existing login page (`app/page.tsx`), update the handleLogin function to redirect based on role:

```typescript
if (response.ok) {
  const { employee } = await response.json();
  
  // Redirect based on role
  if (employee.role === 'admin' || employee.role === 'manager') {
    window.location.href = '/admin/dashboard';
  } else {
    window.location.href = '/employee/timesheet';
  }
}
```

## 2. Update Your Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:

```env
DB_HOST=your-hostinger-mysql-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=u265780679_aromatic_impex
NODE_ENV=development
```
